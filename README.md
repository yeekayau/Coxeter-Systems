# Coxeter-Systems

I have written some SageMath functions to assist with doing computations and examples in my research. 
The Tits_Representation_Coxeter notebook sets up the standard reflection representation of a Coxeter system,
and provides functions to compute the action of a group element on the root system, the elementary roots as well as
some code to compute the root system of a dihedral reflection subgroup.
